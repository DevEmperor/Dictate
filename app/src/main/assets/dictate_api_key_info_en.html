        <b>Dictate</b> supports two speech recognition services:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>➀ Groq Whisper (recommended):</b> <i>Extremely fast</i> and generally <b>free</b> for normal usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>➁ OpenAI Whisper / GPT-4o-transcribe:</b> <i>Highly accurate</i> and widely used. Usage comes with <b>very low costs</b> (around $0.18 per hour of audio), and a <b>credit card</b> is required.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final step is to <b>create an API key 🔑</b>. <b>Dictate</b> uses either <b>Groq</b> or <b>OpenAI Whisper</b> in the background to convert speech into text.<br>
        To do so, you need to create an <b>API key</b> on the provider’s website and enter it into <b>Dictate</b>. Please choose your preferred provider and follow the instructions below. It’s easy:
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p><b>➀ Setup with Groq (free and recommended)</b></p>
    <p>
        <b>Groq</b> offers <b>Whisper</b> with especially fast performance – and currently <b>free of charge</b> for regular usage. The setup is <b>easier</b> than with <b>OpenAI</b> since no payment method is required.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Go to the <a href="https://console.groq.com/keys">Groq API Key page</a> and log in with your <b>Groq account</b>. If you don’t have one yet, you can create one there <b>for free</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Click on <b>'Create API Key'</b>, give the key a name like <i>'Dictate'</i>, and <b>copy</b> the key after it is generated.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Now return to the <b>Dictate app</b>. At the bottom of this screen, you’ll find a <b>text field</b>. Long-press it, and the <b>'Paste'</b> button will appear. Tap it, and the <b>API key</b> will be saved in <b>Dictate</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Now tap the button <b>'Set API Key and Finish Setup'</b>. You’ve successfully completed the setup and can start using <b>Dictate</b>. 🥳
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p><b>➁ Setup with OpenAI (paid)</b></p>
    <p>
        1. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview">Open the OpenAI billing page</a>, log in, and add your <b>credit card 💳</b> by clicking the <b>'Add payment details'</b> button.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. You need to <b>preload credit</b> onto your account. This credit will be used for transcription when using <b>Dictate</b>.<br>
        To do this, click on <b>'Add to credit balance'</b>. A minimum of <b>$5</b> is sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Now that your API access is active, you just need to <b>create the API key 🔑</b> and paste it into the field below.<br>
        Go to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys">API Key page</a> and click <b>'Create new secret key'</b>. You can enter a name like <i>'Dictate Key'</i>, then click the green button.<br>
        After a few moments, a long string of random letters and numbers will appear (starting with <i>'sk-...'</i>). Click <b>'Copy'</b>.<br>
        Now return to the <b>Dictate app</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. At the bottom of this screen, you’ll find a <b>text field</b>. Long-press it, and the <b>'Paste'</b> button will appear. Tap it, and the <b>API key</b> will be saved in <b>Dictate</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. Finally, tap the button <b>'Set API Key and Finish Setup'</b>. You’re all done and ready to use <b>Dictate</b>. 🥳
