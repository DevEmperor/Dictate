/**
 * Visual style of the floating dictation button (issue #88), selectable in the floating-button settings.
 *
 * - [RING]: a compact circular bubble with a thin animated ring that encodes the state (pulse while
 *   recording, spinner while transcribing/rewording).
 * - [PILL]: a circular bubble that expands into a pill while active, showing an elapsed timer and a live
 *   waveform during recording and a labelled spinner while transcribing/rewording.
 * - [ORB]: a solid orb with no ring or bars; the orb glows and pulses with the voice amplitude while
 *   recording and breathes gently while transcribing/rewording.
