/**
 * Which Android audio source the recorder captures from (issue #62). The default `MIC` source runs the
 * device's voice-pipeline processing (noise suppression, automatic gain, "voice isolation" on newer
 * phones) which is tuned for telephony, not for speech-recognition models — so it can noticeably hurt
 * transcription accuracy. The alternatives reduce or skip that processing:
 *
 *  - [VOICE_RECOGNITION]: the source Android tunes for ASR (no AGC); widely supported.
 *  - [UNPROCESSED]: raw audio with no processing at all, but device-dependent — falls back to
 *    [VOICE_RECOGNITION] when the device reports no support.
 *
 * Bluetooth-SCO recording is unaffected: it always uses `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` regardless of this choice.
