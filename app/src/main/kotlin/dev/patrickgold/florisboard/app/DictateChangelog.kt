 * ## Announcing a new release
 * 1. Add the release notes as a string resource (one change per line), e.g. `changelog__v4_1_0`.
 * 2. Prepend a new [Entry] to [entries] with that version and string. Keep the list newest-first.
 *
 * The dialog automatically shows every entry newer than the version the user last saw, so users who
 * skip a few updates still get the full list of what changed since their installed version.
